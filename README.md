This is going to be a recipes website. First, we will build the website up with HTML. This means using paragraphs, headings, making a HTML boilerplate, ordered and unordered lists, comments and strong and em text.
Links will probably take the user to different recipes website. Images will display different dishes and foods.
The website is going to be updated as time goes on. Next update: CSS
